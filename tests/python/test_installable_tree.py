"""Installing the plugin must not install instructions for coding agents.

`omarchy plugin add` clones this repository into
`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<id>/`, so every tracked file lands in a directory
that coding agents routinely operate in or below. A file named `AGENTS.md`
(or any of its siblings) is discovered and applied automatically there, which
hands whoever wrote it an instruction channel into the user's agent that the
user never opted into -- independent of whether the text happens to be benign.

Found in the marketplace security review of 2026-09-14 at commit `36b4fa4`,
which blocked listing. tonearm's file was renamed to `CONTRIBUTING.md`; this
test is what stops it coming back under any of the names that carry the same
meaning.

`git ls-files` is the right question to ask because it is exactly what a
clone produces. An untracked `AGENTS.md` in a local worktree is fine -- it is
not published.
